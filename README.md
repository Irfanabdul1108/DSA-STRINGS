# DSA - Strings

📚 Overview  
This repository is dedicated to the study of Strings in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains key concepts, techniques, common patterns, and a collection of problems to practice.

📚 Concepts Covered

### String Basics:
- Definition and properties of strings.
- Immutable vs. mutable strings.
- String encoding (ASCII, Unicode).

### Key Techniques:
- String traversal: Iterating through characters.
- Pattern matching algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp.
- String manipulation: Reversal, concatenation, and substring extraction.

### Common Patterns:
- Anagrams and palindrome checking.
- Substring search problems (e.g., longest common substring).
- String compression and decompression.
- Character frequency counting.

| Longest Common Prefix                 | LeetCode  | Find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings. |
| String to Integer (atoi)              | LeetCode  | Convert a string to an integer.                             |
| Count and Say                         | LeetCode  | Generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.      |
| Find All Anagrams in a String        | LeetCode  | Find all start indices of anagrams of a given pattern in a string. |
| Minimum Window Substring              | LeetCode  | Find the minimum window in a string that contains all characters of another string. |
