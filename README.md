# DSA - Strings

## üìö Overview

This repository is dedicated to the study of Strings in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains key concepts, techniques, common patterns, and a collection of problems to practice.

## üìö Concepts Covered

- **String Basics**: 
  - Definition and properties of strings.
  - Immutable vs. mutable strings.
  - String encoding (ASCII, Unicode).

- **Key Techniques**:
  - String traversal: Iterating through characters.
  - Pattern matching algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp.
  - String manipulation: Reversal, concatenation, and substring extraction.

- **Common Patterns**:
  - Anagrams and palindrome checking.
  - Substring search problems (e.g., longest common substring).
  - String compression and decompression.
  - Character frequency counting.
